# Reproducing results

## Tools

We have used following RNA-Seq based TCR profiling tools:

* MIXCR (v 3.0.13), https://mixcr.readthedocs.io/en/master/
* IMREP (v 1.0), https://github.com/Mangul-Lab-USC/ImReP
* TRUST4 (v 1.0.2), https://github.com/liulab-dfci/TRUST4

## Data

This study used 20 samples which were sequenced by both TCR-Seq and RNA-Seq. The data included in this repository contains the results of the methods, as well as the processed TCR-Seq data. 

[summary_data](https://github.com/Mangul-Lab-USC/TCR-Seq_benchmarking_publication/tree/main/summary_data) includes the data that created all figures in the manuscript.

## Notebooks and Figures

[notebooks](https://github.com/Mangul-Lab-USC/TCR-Seq_benchmarking_publication/tree/main/notebooks) includes the Jupyter notebooks for all figures in the manuscript. 

[figures](https://github.com/Mangul-Lab-USC/TCR-Seq_benchmarking_publication/tree/main/figures) includes all of the image files for the plots generated by notebooks.
